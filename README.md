#  AutoWrite.vim


Simple AutoWrite Plugin compatible with most if not all vim distributions (Vim/Neovim)


## About

This is a simple plug-in for Vim (and NeoVim) that enables autowriting of the buffer.
It is useful for applications such as [Markdown Previewers](https://github.com/ms-jpq/markdown-live-preview) to automatically render the text in the preview window as you type.
